                An Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) is another indicator like SMA, MMA and EMA, but has more parameters. It
                changes its sensitivity due to the price fluctuations. The Adaptive Moving Average becomes more
                sensitive during periods when price is moving in a certain direction and becomes less sensitive to price
                movements when it become unstable.

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>
                AMA indicator needs five parameters: mapping with value field in it (required), three periods:
                period, fast period and slow period; and a type of series. It is possible to change the series type any
                time using
                the seriesType() method.

        <description>
            <caption>Description</caption>
            <text>Developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, Aroon is an indicator system that determines whether a
                stock is trending or not and how strong the trend is. "Aroon" means "Dawn's Early Light" in Sanskrit.
                Chande
                chose this name because the indicators are designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend.
            </text>
            <text>
                The Aroon indicators measure the number of periods since price recorded an x-day high or low. There are
                two
                separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down. A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a
                25-day
                high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low. In this sense, the Aroon
                indicators are quite different from typical momentum oscillators, which focus on price relative to time.
                Aroon is unique because it focuses on time relative to price. Chartists can use the Aroon indicators to
                spot
                emerging trends, identify consolidations, define correction periods and anticipate reversals.

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>Aroon indicator has only one type specific parameter - period: mapping with value field in it,
                period and types of Up and Down series.

        <description>
            <caption>Description</caption>
            <text>Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures
                volatility. As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in
                mind.
                Commodities are frequently more volatile than stocks. They were are often subject to gaps and limit
                moves,
                which occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility
                formula
                based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder
                created
                Average True Range to capture this "missing" volatility. It is important to remember that ATR does not
                provide an indication of price direction, just volatility.

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>Average True Range indicator has three parameters: mapping, period, which has to be an integer
                value more than 1, and series type.

        <description>
            <caption>Description</caption>
            <text>Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that is displayed as two lines (bands): one
                drawn
                above a simple moving average of the price and one - below. These bands move closer to the moving
                average
                when price volatility is low and move farther away from the moving average when price volatility
                increases.
            </text>

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>Bollinger Bands parameters can be adjusted. The default parameters are: 20 periods for the
                simple moving average and 2 for the standard deviations (the distance between each band and the SMA).
                Increasing the number of periods - decreases the volatility of the SMA, and decreasing their number -
                increases the volatility of the SMA. Increasing the number of standard deviations moves the bands
                farther
                away from the SMA, and decreasing - moves the bands closer to the SMA.
            </text>

            <caption>Function</caption>
            <text>Bollinger Bands are used to determine how volatile a stock is. Stocks move between levels
                of
                high and low volatility, and when the Bollinger bands grip a stock, it is a sign that the stock is
                consolidating and that a breakout is inevitable. When the Bollinger bands widen, it is a sign that the
                stock
                has burst out into a new trend.

            <caption>Description</caption>
            <text>An Exponential Moving Average is a trending indicator - a single line that shows the
                weighted
                mean of the stock price during a specified period of time. This type of moving average that is similar
                to a
                Simple Moving Average, except that more weight is given to the latest data.
            </text>

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>EMA period parameter can be adjusted. The default parameter is 20 periods. Increasing the
                number of periods will decrease the volatility, and decreasing the number of periods will increase the
                volatility.
            </text>

            <caption>Function</caption>
            <text>Exponential Moving Averages are used by traders to detect the trend of the stock and to
                identify possible levels of support and resistance. If the Exponential Moving Average is trending higher
                and
                the price is above it, the stock is considered to be in an uptrend, in other case - if it is trending
                lower
                and the price is below it, the stock is considered to be in a downtrend. Also, when the price is above
                an
                uptrending EMA line, the Exponential Moving Average can act as a possible support level. In the same
                way,
                when the price below a downtrending EMA line - the Exponential Moving Average can act as a possible
                resistance level.

                these lines move in a range between 0 and 100. The full stochastic shows the interrelation of the
                current
                closing price to the trading range in the past. If the current closing price is toward the top of the
                past
                trading range, %K moves higher. If the current closing price is toward the bottom of the past trading

                the
                time frame, 5 periods for the %K, and 3 periods for the %D smoothing. Increasing the number of periods
                for
                the time frame decreases the volatility of the full stochastic, decreasing the number of periods for the
                time frame increases the volatility of the full stochastic. Increasing the number of periods for the %K
                decreases the volatility of the %K line, and decreasing the number of periods for the time frame
                increases
                the volatility of the %K line. Also, increasing the number of periods for the %D smoothing decrease the
                volatility of the %D line, and decreasing the number of periods for the time frame increases the

            <text>KDJ indicator is a technical indicator used to analyze and predict changes in stock trends
                and
                price patterns in a traded asset. KDJ indicator is also known as the random index. It is a very
                practical
                technical indicator which is most commonly used in market trend analysis of short-term stock.
            </text>
            <text>KDJ is a derived form of the Stochastic Oscillator Indicator with the only difference of having an
                extra
                line called the J line. Values of %K and %D lines show if the security is overbought (over 80) or
                oversold
                (below 20). The moments of %K crossing %D are the moments for selling or buying. The J line represents
                the
                divergence of the %D value from the %K. The value of J can go beyond [0, 100] for %K and %D lines on the
                chart.

                A Modified Moving Average (MMA) (also known as Running Moving Average (RMA), or SMoothed Moving Average
                (SMMA)) is an indicator that shows the average value of a security's price over a period of time. It
                works
                very similar to the Exponential Moving Average, they are equivalent but for different periods (e.g. the
                MMA
                value for a 14-day period will be the same as EMA-value for a 27-days period).
            </text>
            <text>MMA is partly calculated like SMA: the first point of the MMA is calculated the same way it is done
                for
                SMA.
                However, other points are calculated differently:the new price is added first and then the last average
                is
                subtracted from the resulting sum.
            </text>

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>MMA indicator needs three parameters, as SMA and EMA: mapping with value field in it,
                period
                and a type of series. It is possible to change the series type at any time using the seriesType()
                method.

            <caption>Description</caption>
            <text>
                The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is a momentum indicator that consists of two lines - an
                indicator line and a signal line. The indicator line displays the difference between two exponential
                moving
                averages with different smoothing factors, and the signal line displays an exponential moving average of
                the
                difference between mentioned two exponential moving averages.
            </text>

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>MACD parameters can be adjusted. The default parameters are 26 for the slow exponential
                moving
                average, 12 for the fast exponential moving average and 20 for the signal line. Decreasing any of the
                parameters decreases the volatility of the related line, and increasing them - increases the volatility
                of
                the related line.
            </text>

            <caption>Function</caption>
            <text>The MACD is used to determine is there bullish or bearish momentum behind a stock. When
                the
                indicator line is above the signal line, the MACD shows bullish momentum, and the indicator line below
                the
                signal line in the MACD shows bearish momentum.

            <caption>Description</caption>
            <text>
                The Rate of Change oscillator is a momentum indicator that consists of one line. The ROC measures the
                percentage change in the price from one trading period to the next. If the percentage change is big, the
                ROC
                line moves harshly up or down, depending on price changing direction. In other case - if the percentage
                change is small, the ROC line moves slowly up or down, depending on the price changing direction.
            </text>

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>The ROC indicator parameters can be adjusted. The default parameter is 12 periods for the
                time
                frame. Increasing the number of periods for the time frame decreases the volatility of the ROC
                indicator,
                and decreasing the number of periods for the time frame increases the volatility of the ROC indicator.

                The ROC line above the zero line shows bullish momentum, and the ROC line below the zero line shows
                bearish
                momentum.

            <text>
                The Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillator is a momentum indicator that consists of one line that
                moves in
                a range between 0 and 100.
            </text>

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>The RSI parameters are adjustable. The default parameter is 14 periods for the time frame.
                Increasing the number of periods for the time frame decreases the volatility of the RSI, and decreasing
                the
                number of periods for the time frame decreases it.

                The RSI line moving higher shows bullish momentum, and the RSI line moving lower shows bearish momentum.
                Also, the RSI line above 70 shows the market may be overbought, and the RSI line below 30 - the market
                may
                be oversold.

            <caption>Description</caption>
            <text>
                A Simple Moving Average is a trending indicator that is displayed as a single line that shows the mean
                price
                during a specified period of time. For example, a 20-day SMA shows the average stock price during the
                last
                20 trading periods (including the current period).
            </text>

            <caption>Parameters</caption>
            <text>SMA period parameter can be adjusted. The default parameter is 20 periods. Increasing the
                number of periods will decrease the volatility, and decreasing the number of periods will increase the
                volatility.
            </text>

            <caption>Usage</caption>
            <text>Simple Moving Averages are used by traders to detect the trend of the stock and to
                identify
                possible levels of support and resistance. If the Simple Moving Average is trending higher and the price
                is
                above it, the stock is considered to be in an uptrend, in other case - if it is trending lower and the
                price
                is below it, the stock is considered to be in a downtrend. Also, when the price is above an uptrending
                SMA
                line, the Simple Moving Average can act as a possible support level. In the same way, when the price
                below a
                downtrending SMA line - the Simple Moving Average can act as a possible resistance level.
