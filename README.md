# Technical Indicators
Need to analyze your data? Our JS charts include dozens of pre-built technical indicators
and you can easily create your own.

## Modifying source code
There is two possible options of modifying demo source code, [using Node.js and npm](#using-node.js-and-npm)
and [with no additional requirements](#with-no-additional-requirements).

### Using Node.js and npm
This option is recommend because it runs all development environment you need:
* Runs Node.js server with the demo on `http://localhost:3000/`.
* Watches for changes in source files and rebuilds distribution files on the fly.
* Dynamically reload web page using [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/) tool.

Please, ensure you have all [requirements](#installing-requirements) installed before running.  
Then, to run demo with Nodej.js and npm, use following commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:anychart-solutions/technical-indicators.git
cd technical-indicators
gulp
```

Now, when all environment is up and running, you may use following instructions to modify source code:
* To modify demo stylesheets, edit `src/sass/*.scss` files.
* To modify demo JavaScript, edit `src/js/index.js` file.
* To modify demo markup, edit `src/index.html` file.
* To modify available indicators and default settings, edit `src/indicators.xml` file.
* To modify available data sources, edit `chartDataSelect` select options.

### With no additional requirements
This option doesn't require Node.js and npm installation, but you have to run web-server anyway.
Also it imposes some limitations on demo source code modification process.
* To run demo, please, open index.html page with your web-server.
* To modify demo stylesheets, please add your own `<styles>` section to `src/index.html` file.
* Unfortunately, here is no way to modify demo JavaScript code except adding your own `<script>` section to `src/index.html` file.
* To modify demo markup, edit `src/index.html` file.
* To modify list of available indicators and default settings, edit `src/indicators.xml` file.
* To modify data sources, edit `chartDataSelect` select options.
* To make a production build you need to copy all required files to distribution folder by your own.

## Running on production
All production files are located in [distribution](https://github.com/anychart-solutions/technical-indicators/tree/master/dist) folder.
In case you did some modification of the source code, you need to rebuild production files as mentioned in [Using Node.js and npm](#using-node.js-and-npm) section or manually.

## Installing requirements
To run demo development environment, please, ensure you have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), overwise:
* To install Node.js and npm, visit [installation instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) page.
* To install gulp globally using `npm install gulp -g` command.
* To install git, visit [installation instructions|https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git] page.
